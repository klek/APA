Stuff I have done to get a working build:

Installed CCSv6.2 (for linux)
	- Make sure you add the cc3200 when installing
	- I also installed support for Tiva-C and MSP430

Installed CC3200SDK
	- This was windows release only, but installed it with wine and some filecopying...

Followed these docs to test it:
http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/swru376d/swru376d.pdf
http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/swru372b/swru372b.pdf (mostly to find pins...)

The docs that come with the SDK (under Your_SDK_install/docs) is also very useful

===================================================================================================

Project creation:

File > New > CCS Project

Choose target as "Wireless Connectivity MCU" + "CC3200"

Choose a project name

Create a project with empty main


When project is created, rightclick the project and choose properties.

Resources > Linked Resources > Path Variables > New

Add a new variable "CC3200_SDK_ROOT" to YOUR_SDK_INSTALL directory

Close and open project properties again.

Build > ARM Compiler > Include Options

Under "Add dir to #include..." add the following includes:

CC3200_SDK_ROOT/example/common
CC3200_SDK_ROOT/driverlib
CC3200_SDK_ROOT/inc
CCE_INSTALL_ROOT/tools/compiler/arm_15.12.3.LTS/include

Close and open project properties again.

Build > ARM Compiler > Advance Options > Predefine Symbols

Make sure the following predefined names are there

ccs
cc3200
NON_NETWORK

Close and open project properties again.

Build > ARM Linker > File Search Path

Under "Include library file or ..." add the driverlib.a as follows:

CC3200_SDK_ROOT/driverlib/ccs/Release/driverlib.a

Close the properties.

Finally we want to add two new files to the project.

Right click on the project > New > File > Advanced

Make sure to check the box "Link to file in the file system".

Add the file gpio_if.c from "${CC3200_SDK_ROOT}/example/common/gpio_if.c"

Do the exact same procedure once again but instead add the file startup_ccs.c from

"${CC3200_SDK_ROOT}/example/common/startup_ccs.c"

===================================================================================================

That should be all I have done to get it working...just ask otherwise
